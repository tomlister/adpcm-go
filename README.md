## Upload notice

This project was originally created by [bovarysme](https://github.com/bovarysme), but for some unknown reason, the repository was removed. Because the project was released under the MIT license, [JoshuaDoes](https://github.com/JoshuaDoes) re-uploaded it due to its usage in another project of theirs. I forked it as I needed to quickly modify it for use in my own project.
